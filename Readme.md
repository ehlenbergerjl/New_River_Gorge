#### Project name: Refugees vs Host Nation GDP

**Brief introduction:** This web map was created as a visualization of the refugees per capita versus the host nation's wealth as indicated by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita / purchasing power parity (PPP) expressed in units of Current International Dollars (GK$)*. All data is current as of 2020.

**Major functions:** GeoJson manipulation; Use of listeners, basemap, legend, information boxes, and tooltips.
Libraries and plugins: Fontawesome, JQuery, Chroma, AJAX, and Leaflet.

\*GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)
This indicator provides per capita values for gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the country plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that controls for price level differences between countries. Total population is a mid-year population based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. (World Bank, 2021)
